This is the main project context:

I'm working on a tool called UniverSQL that allows you to run Snowflake SQL on Snowflake iceberg tables without ETL.
We've got it working so that it works with Snowflake Iceberg tables and stages.
I am looking to run a TPC-DI benchmark study on Snowflake and through UniverSQL to see how it compares.
I'm looking for help generating the queries for this.
